eRM DMZ K8S Migration (10/13)

As SD, to enable SoIC business, implement the dynamic process attribute and bond type GWT UI to MB, QM, and TL5 to maintain attribute UI by DB without code change, provide SC control flag by DB to enable/disable SoIC attribute on maintain, submit, and rule check to save user data initial effort on release day. For search Tl5 service that provide to Tapeout also can search by SoIC attribute, add search by SoIC information process to the existed complicate search flow.
Provide that enable QM can maintain with MB dynamic process attribute and bond type solution and accepted by YS.
Not only enable search Tl5 service, but also arrange the search flow material to save survey effort for future requirement change.
Design and build the reusable search Tl5 regression test that can to guarantee quality once flow changed.

As SD, for iTCMB-phase2 release on 2020/07/01, to gain performance in MB/TL/QM submit/active as-is heavy flow, integration duplicated heavy rule check report flow in different transaction to do once time during submit. For further UI reuse add flag control to Test line Digi. Tone and KD/KC compare (by MB Code) report new function. Provide web service framework template first to team member during implement active, MB/QM compare and all i-Attachment report web service to EDW.

Improve i-Attachment 100K+ records report generate time from 4mins. to 45sec. by solve TI module EJB/JPA auto flush issue.


Teamwork: For PDM portal migration as TI team owner apply the JV Token to TI module with good quality release, take information to section and cooperate with PI team MY.

Potential: Perform good performance and quality on Ant to Maven weblogic/JBOSS to K8S migration task and can provide solid material and consultant.

Area for Improvement: Sometimes for user emergency operation, it can make a trade-off by simplify some unreasonable complexity requirement with simple raw data to save some unnecessary effort.
