Major Accomplishment: 
As SD, for iTCMB-phase2 release on 2020/06/30, besides refactor MB/TL/QM submit and active flow and implement new Test line Digi. Tone and KD/KC compare (by MB Code) report function, provide active, MB/QM compare and all i-Attachment report web service to EDW. This change can increase user productivity by replace current manual MB review and assign TCMB no. in active process after submit to auto flow by interaction with EDW.
-Provide auto Active MB web service to replace trigger by EDW MQ flow and coordinate UAT with EDW/User by myself and release on 2020/02/18.
-During UAT phase, give a suggestion to EDW 珮姍 that solve EDW add meta info. to TL Digi. report flow performance issue from 3mins. to 30sec.
-Improve i-Attachment 100K+ records report generate time from 4mins. to 45sec. by solve TI module EJB/JPA auto flush issue.

As module lead, for Online DMZ/Internal K8S migration, besides perform 2020/02/18 Online internal Admin K8S migration with Jboss SLB/DNS/Server sunset, sort out the system structure, find and take over the data sync batch project belong to EAM with migration quickly. Not only finish authCheck, SSOAuth Ant to Maven, but also Weblogic code base to Jboss EAP (wildfly14.0.1) structure with SOP before schedule and provide DMZ K8S migration related consultant to BS and ZY continually for 2020/06/09 release.
-share Ant to Maven and weblogic to jboss material and provide consult to HC/BS/ZY
-As ST/UAT coordinator with SA and SD, provide ST/UAT env., code/function tree deployment, all developers DDL and DML integration for one time effort.

As module lead, follow CPSD internal K8S migration plan on 2019/12. Migrate eRM old Ant structure to Maven on wildfly8 to wildfly11 and migrate TMR Tapeout Simulation batch, Search TL2 web service on weblogic to wildfly11 for sunset. As SD, migrate Generate Composite TL43/TL45 Batch and take effort to create scheduler on batch code module as a solution that can save K8S to EC1 Batch Server firewall apply effort for PI_FAB_LOGISTIC migration on 2019/11.
-For further eRM DMZ migration, implement a property check flow to fix as-is hardcode check by weblogic or jboss server to distinct login from Online or BCP.
-Restructure eRM as-is one module project (means front codes and backend code in same module) to best practice structure to three module (web, core, common) for better Maven project control.

Teamwork:
Cooperate with SA, OC and EAM to build Holdable stage and TA CCOP for system healthy monitor and finish TI Team [PAM, TWiDMZ] PAM User Account Annual Review with SC/ICSD.

Potential:
Try to take module lead tasks because having experience of handle a project such as CF migration and TA migration.

Area for Improvement:
Need to raise up TI domain such MB self judgement on user unreasonable request for reducing operation cycle time.
